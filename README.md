Indeed, this is a slower process since accessing the info bits on the hard drive is a more time-consuming mechanical process (the heads of the hard drive move towards the suitable platter, cylinder, and section of the disk surface where the bits are stored) than accessing the memory RAM chips. This means that your newly opened application is now stored in the virtual memory on the hard drive. Therefore, your computer will perform very poorly.
